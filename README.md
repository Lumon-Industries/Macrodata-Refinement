## How will I know what to work on?

First, you will be assigned a macrodata file. This selection has been made carefully by your superior.

After opening your file you will be met with a sea of numbers that seems to stretch endlessly in all directions.

Over time, certain clusters of numbers will start to make you feel a certain way.

There are four categories of numbers, each of which elicits a different feeling. A refiner's job is to fill each of the five bins evenly with the four kinds of number clusters.

Once every bin is properly filled, the file is 100% refined and the job is done.

```
WO: These numbers elicit melancholy or despair.
FC: These numbers elicit joy, gaiety or ecstasy.
DR: These numbers elicit fear, anxiety or apprehension.
MA: These numbers elicit rage or a desire to do harm.
```



## Sample macrodata view

This is a sample of what your file might look like. If you find clusters of numbers that look scary, you should bin them.
